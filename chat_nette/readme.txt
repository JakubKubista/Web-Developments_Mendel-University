Goal of the project:

Notes about implementation:
As can be seen, I made 2015 this project for school and 2017 refactor it, because code was very confused and ugly for publish. There is still many things, which needs improve. I really looking forward to comparison between this code and for example codes from 2019.

I used bitbucket.org/Kyblik for versioning. I wanted demonstrate my progress in programming on  github.com/JakubKubista, where I pushed school version from 2015 as the first commit and refactored version from 2017.
